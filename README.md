# CustomTexturedButtons
Short tutorial on how to create custom buttons for your main menu (or any GUI)..

1]
  Download both the template image and class and put it in your desired directory. (you will also have to set the directory in the class as it uses ResourceLocation)
  
2]
  In your GUI class (where you want to use the custom buttons), you will need to go to the line where the button is specified (it is         usually called "GuiButton") and you'll need to replace that with your class name, import it, and remove the arguments so that it matches   the class.
